# Unclear Firebase Errors During Setup and Authentication

This repository demonstrates an issue with unclear error messages from the Firebase JavaScript SDK during project initialization and user authentication.  The provided code snippets illustrate the problem and offer a solution involving more robust error handling and logging.

## Problem

The Firebase SDK can sometimes throw generic or unhelpful error messages when encountering configuration problems or authentication failures. This makes debugging challenging, as the root cause isn't immediately apparent.

## Solution

The solution involves implementing more detailed error handling using `try...catch` blocks and logging more comprehensive information. This allows developers to identify the specific issue and resolve it more efficiently.

## How to Run

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Install Firebase: `npm install firebase`
3.  Configure your Firebase project and replace placeholders in the code with your project credentials.
4.  Run `node firebaseBug.js` to reproduce the problem.
5.  Run `node firebaseSolution.js` to see the improved error handling.
